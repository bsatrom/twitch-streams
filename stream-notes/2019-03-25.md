## What we did

### Wrapping up Brew Buddy (1 hour)

- [X]  Review [submitting PR to electric-io](https://github.com/noopkat/electric-io/pull/107)
    - [X]  It was merged, yay!
- [X] Gonna go through a few final issues this morning and then move onto a NEW project
    - [-]  Turn off TFT in sleep mode - *turns out, I need to bodge the BL pin on the TFT into the Argon to try this. Gonna look into it off-stream.*
    - [X]  Double-check my battery reading logic - *this looked ok, so we didn't change it*
    - [X]  Double check fermentation rate logic - *a single knock was being detected as multiple, so I implemented a "debounce" to filter out knocks that happen too close together.*

  *It's been fun working on Brew Buddy, but its time to move on...*

### Starting the Wall of Things (1 hour)

- [X]  NEW Project: [The Wall of Things!!!](https://github.com/bsatrom/wall-of-things)
    - [X]  Plan is to take this pegboard wall and add a 24x7 camera (and public website) to it
    - [X]  Over time, I want to to add a number of sensors and projects to this (Happy Plant, panel, servo arm, etc.)
        - [X]  We'll add Brew Buddy to this wall as well for automated testing
    - [X]  Today, we're going to start a Twitch chatbot to control the Neopixel strips
    - [X]  Walk through what the [Neopixel strips do now](https://github.com/bsatrom/wall-of-things/tree/master/wot-firmware/wot-neopixel-strips)
    - [X]  Start working on the chatbot
        - [X]  Use [TMI.js](https://docs.tmijs.org/v1.2.1/index.html)
        - [X]  New node project (npm init)
        - [X]  Put it in the [WoT Repo](https://github.com/bsatrom/wall-of-things/tree/master/wot-bot) - *sticking with the monorepo approach here... for now*
    - [X] Features added
      - Connect the cyanpandabot
      - Listen for `connected` and `message` events
      - Display the number of devices I have online
      - Start the Mesh chase animation with the `!chase` command
      - Roll the `!dice`

## What I learned

- The particle-js-api is also awesome! üíô
- Context switching between C++ and JavaScript == (or ===) Brandon makes mistakes! ü§£
