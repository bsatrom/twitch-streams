## What we did

### Google Coral Object Detection Demo! (15 min)

- [X] Using the [instructions here](https://coral.withgoogle.com/tutorials/devboard-camera/) I want to hook a logitech camera up to the Coral Dev Board and run a few demos (face tracking, object classification)
- [X] SSH into the board, and run this command to make sure the USB camera is connected: `v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext --device /dev/video1`
- [X] Download the object classification and image detection models and labels
- [X] Run the object classification model using a streaming server. (Bump down the resolution and FPS a bit from the default command)

```bash
edgetpu_classify_server \
--source /dev/video1:YUY2:640x480:20/1  \
--model ${TEST_DATA}/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224_quant_edgetpu.tflite \
--labels ${TEST_DATA}/imagenet_labels.txt
```

- [X] Run the face detection model using a streaming server. (Bump down the resolution and FPS a bit from the default command)

```bash
edgetpu_detect_server \
--source /dev/video1:YUY2:640x480:20/1  \
--model ${TEST_DATA}/mobilenet_ssd_v2_face_quant_postprocess_edgetpu.tflite
```

### Continuing the Wall of Things (1 hour, 45 min)

- [X] Review what we got working last time
- [X] Off stream, I moved the command if statements into a command object to save us on if/switch mess

- [ ] Things I want to do in the bot today:
  - [X] Use the user/context object to add the chatting username to response messages.
  - [X] Fix online command to show actual, online `connected: true` devices (currently its every one I own)
  - [X] Add the `!chase-color` command to set the light color 
      - we decided to add this to the chase command
  - [ ] Add the `!chase-stop` command
  - [ ] Detect cheers, follows and subs and trigger a fireworks animation on all strips, in sync.

- [ ] Things I want to do in firmware today:
  - [X] Make the chase color function settable.

```js
{ "red": 23, "green": 50, "blue": 25 }
```

  - [ ] Add a fireworks/pulse animation mode for bits/sub commands.


## What we learned

- [VICTORY](https://clips.twitch.tv/CarefulHeartlessCucumberUWot)!
