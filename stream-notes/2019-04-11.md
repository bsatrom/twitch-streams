## What we did

### Show and Tell (5 minutes)

- [X] Green screen!

### Continuing the Wall of Things (1 hour, 45 min.)

- [X] Review what we did last time

- [ ] Things I want to do in the bot today:
  - [X] accept CSS shorthand values (ex. expand #fc0 into #ffcc00)
  - [X] Accept named colors (ex. cyan, magenta, red, green, blue, salmon)
  - [ ] Detect cheers, follows and subs and trigger a fireworks (or disco mode as per [cooperCLAY](https://www.twitch.tv/cooperCLAY)) animation on all strips, in sync.
  - [X] Add a `!breathe` command

- [ ] Things I want to do in firmware today:
  - [X] Install a beta version of v0.9.1 on the Argon to improve gateway reliability 
  - [ ] Implement disco mode for bits/subs, etc.
  - [X] Implement a pulse/breathe mode

## What we learned / Ideas for next time

- [ ] I need to add a `!lurk` command to chat
- [X] dot_commie suggested using [TinyColor](https://bgrins.github.io/TinyColor/) for CSS and named color handling in the bot and it is awesome!
- [ ] Consider adding alternating colors to the chase animation
- [ ] Controller still timing out, but it seems to happen when chase mode or color changes are triggered
- [X] Found an [awesome collection of LED Strip animations](https://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/arduino/adruino-led-strip-effects/#LEDStripEffectFadeInandFadeOutRedGreenandBlue) with support for both NeoPixel and FastLED!
