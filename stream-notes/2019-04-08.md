## What we did

### Show and Tell (10 minutes)

- [X] Adafruit PyPortal
- [X] MxChip IoT DevKit
- [X] Jetson Nano Developer Kit

### Continuing the Wall of Things (1 hour, 45 min.)

- [X] Review what we did last time
- [X] Off stream, I updated all four strips to respond to the new `setColors` function on the gateway.

- [ ] Things I want to do in the bot today:
  - [X] Add support for Hex colors
  - [X] Set colors even when the chase command is active
  - [X] Add the `!stop` command
  - [X] Change the mode to `!rainbow`
  - [ ] Detect cheers, follows and subs and trigger a fireworks (or disco mode as per [cooperCLAY](https://www.twitch.tv/cooperCLAY)) animation on all strips, in sync.

- [ ] Things I want to do in firmware today:
  - [X] Add support for Hex colors
  - [ ] Add a fireworks/pulse animation mode for bits/subs, etc.

## What we learned / Ideas for next time

- [ ] [ProfessorStrawberry](https://www.twitch.tv/ProfessorStrawberry) asked about the power draw of the devices on the Wall. We should measure that.
- [X] The left LED strip appears to be mis-calibrated (or needs to be replaced)
- [ ] Accept CSS shorthand values ([parithon](https://www.twitch.tv/parithon)'s idea) [ex. #FFF = #FFFFFF #FC0 = #FFCC00] 
- [ ] Accept named colors ([dot_commie](https://www.twitch.tv/dot_commie)'s idea) [i.e. cyan, salmon, magenta]
- [X] The LTE gateway is dropping too much; Switch to an Argon (Wi-Fi) for prototyping.
- [X] Many thanks to [parithon](https://www.twitch.tv/parithon) for the five gifted subs!
